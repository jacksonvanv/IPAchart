# IPA Chart

Website hosted here: https://ipachart.netlify.app/

This is an interactive IPA (international phoentic alphabet) chart for use by linguists and language enthusiasts. The IPA is a way linguists categorize all known sounds present across all human languages. This page has common IPA tables, as well as sound files that show the user the pronunciation of the phoneme.

When looking at current IPA tables, I noticed two things: many aren't interactive and most haven't been updated in over ten years. Linguistics has made tons of progress as a field, so this chart is up to date with current knowledge and corresponding sound bytes. Also, many current charts look outdated, so I built this page with a clean, minmalist look in mind. As a linguistics minor, I'm using this chart as a reference whenever I need to employ the IPA.

Some key elements of my development process include:
1. Incorporating sound bytes
2. Optimizing loading time
3. Building a sleek UI
4. Making the tables responsive to different window sizes and devices

Coming soon:
1. Displaying a more in-depth vowel chart
2. Including non-pulmonic consonants and clicks
